# Power BI Vizualization 
### Work Card Board
Power BI Vizualization to display cards in a board like Kanban.

Cards defined by *Title* and *Owner* are grouped in *State* columns. The vertical position is defined by the *Priority Index* column

#### Parameters
Colors, text sizes, stage definition and highlight background color

#### Notes

- The number of stages depends on the columns stated in column header.

- Custom Visualization file is in the [dist folder](https://github.com/luisalvesmartins/powerbivizworkcardboard/tree/master/dist).

- When updating/upgrading the control you need to save the report, close powerbi and open it again. PowerBi needs to update the cache, so it needs restart.
